    <span class="meeting_text"> With regards to global development, asking how you would spend $75 billion is more than
        just an intellectual exercise; it is a way to identify the areas of spending
        where we could achieve the most good. It is also a way of identifying areas
        where there isn't enough research, or where the benefits are not as big as we might assume. The Copenhagen
        Consensus Center is a think tank that researches and publishes the
        smartest solutions to the
        world's biggest problems. Their studies are conducted by more than 300 economists from internationally renowned
        institutions, including seven Nobel Laureates, to advise policymakers and philanthropists how to achieve the
        best
        results with their limited resources.</span>
